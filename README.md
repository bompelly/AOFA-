AOFA-gallery
This repository contains a Python script for converting JPEG images to PNG format and extracting unique colors from the images. The script also generates a text file listing the unique colors found in the image.
To use this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the Pillow library. You can install Pillow using pip:
****pip install Pillow
Place the JPEG image you want to convert in the AOFA-gallery directory.
Execute the script with the path to your image file
****python convert_image.py path/to/your/image.jpg
Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path to your image file.

Output:
The script will generate two files:
A PNG image converted from the original JPEG image.
A text file listing all unique colors found in the image.
